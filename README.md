# Regional-Disparities-Among-Indian-states-and-Ut
In this project, we analysed regional disparities in economic development across  different states and union territories of India. We employed a comprehensive  approach, integrating multiple economic indicators and advanced data analysis  techniques to gain insights into the economic landscape of India.
Our analysis revealed distinct patterns of economic development across different regions, with some regions showing higher levels of development compared to others. Descriptive analysis provided a summary of key economic indicators, while regression analysis identified factors influencing regional economic development. Cluster analysis grouped regions with similar economic development characteristics, allowing us to identify clusters of regions with similar economic development profiles.Visualization techniques such as scatter plots and choropleth maps helped illustrate regional disparities in economic development and provided valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders. Understanding these regional disparities is crucial for designing targeted interventions aimed at reducing disparities and fostering balanced and inclusive economic growth across all regions of India.
