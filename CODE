CODE for the project 
Future Scope:
1. Temporal Analysis: Extend the analysis to examine how regional 
disparities in economic development have evolved over time. Analyzing 
trends over time can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of 
economic development in different regions.
2. Impact Assessment: Conduct impact assessments of various policy 
interventions and development programs on regional economic 
development. This can help evaluate the effectiveness of past 
interventions and inform future policy decisions.
3. Predictive Modelling: Develop predictive models to forecast future 
economic development trends in different regions. Machine learning 
algorithms can be used to identify patterns and make predictions based on 
historical data.
4. Incorporate Additional Data: Include additional socio-economic and 
demographic variables to enrich the analysis and provide a more 
comprehensive understanding of regional disparities in economic 
development.
5. Policy Recommendations: Provide specific policy recommendations 
based on the analysis to address regional disparities and promote 
inclusive economic growth. These recommendations can be tailored to 
the specific needs and characteristics of different regions.
